What is Software architecture? 
	Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system — the way its components are organized, how they interact, and the guiding principles that shape its design and evolution.

	It defines how the system works as a whole, not just what it does.
	It’s about making the big decisions early:

	How components communicate

	How data flows

	How to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance

	In simple words:

	Software architecture is the blueprint that turns code into a coherent, reliable system.
